SUMMARY = "Module for decorators, wrappers and monkey patching."
DESCRIPTION = "The aim of the wrapt module is to provide a transparent object \
proxy for Python, which can be used as the basis for the construction of \
function wrappers and decorator functions.\
\
The wrapt module focuses very much on correctness. It therefore goes way \
beyond existing mechanisms such as functools.wraps() to ensure that decorators \
preserve introspectability, signatures, type checking abilities etc. The \
decorators that can be constructed using this module will work in far more \
scenarios than typical decorators and provide more predictable and consistent \
behaviour.\
\
To ensure that the overhead is as minimal as possible, a C extension module is \
used for performance critical components. An automatic fallback to a pure \
Python implementation is also provided where a target system does not have a \
compiler to allow the C extension to be compiled."
